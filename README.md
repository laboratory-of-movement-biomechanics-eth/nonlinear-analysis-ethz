 ## Welcome

Nonlinear analyses are increasingly being used to describe complex physiological conditions, where linear techniques have proven inadequate, confounding scientific study, and hindering the development of meaningful therapeutic options. For instance, nonlinear analysis has been applied to research on [**aging**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11875196/), [**heart rate irregularities**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4801222/), [**posture**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16271008/), [**movement disorders**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32655400/), and [**epileptic seizure**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9771751/) among others. Despite the growing research interest, the adoption of nonlinear characteristics into clinical practice has been limited. Our [**workshop**](https://nonlinearanalysis.ethz.ch/) is bringing together leading researchers in the field of nonlinear analysis to ETHZ Switzerland to foster discussion of ideas and directions to make progress in its study and usage of these techniques in clinical care.
 
The workshop specifically focuses on the following nonlinear characteristics and corresponding tools (both established and emerging) to quantify them from biological data (particularly movement).

1.	Divergence of movement
2.	Regularity of movement 
3.	Recurrences of movement
4.	Complexity of movement

This repository consists of:
1.	Introduction and exercise materials  
2.	Code samples and example data 
3.	Data repository
4.	Keynote presentations
