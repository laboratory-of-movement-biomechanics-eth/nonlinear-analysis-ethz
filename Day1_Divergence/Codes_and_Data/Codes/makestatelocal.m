function [state]=makestatelocal(signal,hc,n_dim,delay)
% build a state space for the calculation of local dynamic stability. a
% standard delay of 10 samples is chosen, and the signal is resampled so
% that on average each stride is 100 samples in length ( see England &
% granata)
% Input:    signal: the signal you want to make a state space for.
%           hc: vector with moments (in samples) in which heelstrikes happen.
%           ideally, has the same number of elements for each subject/
%           condition, as the number of strides has been shown to influence
%           lds calculations.
%           n_dim: number of dimensions that the state space should consits of.
%           delay: (optional!) delay in samples. When no input is given,
%           this is set to 10. 
% Output    state: n_dim dimensional state space, where all the states have
%           been normalized such that there length is (length(hc)-1)*100 samples
%           (i.e. 100 samples per stride on average.
